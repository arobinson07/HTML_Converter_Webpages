        <h2>History</h2>
        <h3>Kelvin</h3>
        <p>The kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), having the unit symbol K.
             It is named after the Belfast-born, Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin 
             (1824–1907). The kelvin is now defined by fixing the numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to 1.380 649×10−23 
             J⋅K−1. This unit is equal to kg⋅m2⋅s−2⋅K−1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of the Planck 
             constant, the speed of light, and the duration of the caesium-133 ground-state hyperfine transition.[1] Thus, this 
             definition depends only on universal constants, and not on any physical artifacts as practiced previously, such as 
             the International Prototype of the Kilogram, whose mass diverged over time from the original value.</p>
        <h3>Celsius</h3>
        <p>The Newton scale is a temperature scale devised by Isaac Newton in 1701.
            He called his device a "thermometer", but he did not use the term "temperature", 
            speaking of "degrees of heat" (gradus caloris) instead. Newton's publication represents 
            the first attempt to introduce an objective way of measuring (what would come to be called)
             temperature (alongside the Rømer scale published at nearly the same time). Newton likely 
             developed his scale for practical use rather than for a theoretical interest in 
             thermodynamics; he had been appointed Warden of the Mint in 1695, and Master of the Mint 
             in 1699, and his interest in the melting points of metals are likely inspired by his duties
              in connection with the Royal Mint.
